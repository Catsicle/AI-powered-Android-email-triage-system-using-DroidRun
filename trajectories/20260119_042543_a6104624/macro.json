SEARCH for unread emails:\n       - Tap the search bar at the top of Gmail\n       - Type the text: is:unread\n       - Press Enter or tap the search button to execute the search\n       - Wait for search results to load\n    \n    2. SELECT the first email:\n       - Look at the search results list\n       - IF the list is empty (no results), return an EMPTY 'EmailList' and STOP\n       - Tap the first/top email in the results to open it\n       - Opening the email will automatically mark it as read\n    \n    3. CHECK if this is a thread (multiple emails in one conversation):\n       - Look for text like \"(2)\", \"(3)\", etc. next to the sender name\n       - Look for \"Show message history\" or multiple message blocks\n       - If it's a thread, focus on the LATEST/MOST RECENT message in the thread\n    \n    4. EXTRACT the following data from the LATEST message only. If missing, use \"Unknown\":\n       - Name: Sender display name (from the most recent message)\n       - Email: Sender email address (in < > brackets)\n       - Subject: Email subject line (from the thread)\n       - Time: Timestamp of the most recent message (usually top right)\n       - Text: Main email body content of the LATEST message only (not the entire thread history)\n    \n    5. IMPORTANT: \n       - For threads, only extract the newest unread message, not old messages\n       - Look for the message that is currently unread/bold\n       - Ignore quoted text or previous messages in the thread\n    \n    6. Go back: Tap the Back button to return to the search results.\n    \n    7. Return the extracted data.\n    \n    NOTE: The email is now marked as read automatically, so the next \"is:unread\" search will show different emails.\n    ",
