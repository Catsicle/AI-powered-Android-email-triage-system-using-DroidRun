Tap the first/top email to open it.\n       - IF the list is empty, return an EMPTY 'EmailList' and STOP.\n       - Opening the email will automatically mark it as read\n    \n    3. CHECK if this is a thread (multiple emails in one conversation):\n       - Look for text like \"(2)\", \"(3)\", etc. next to the sender name\n       - Look for \"Show message history\" or multiple message blocks\n       - If it's a thread, focus on the LATEST/MOST RECENT message in the thread\n    \n    4. EXTRACT the following data from the LATEST message only. If missing, use \"Unknown\":\n       - Name: Sender display name (from the most recent message)\n       - Email: Sender email address (in < > brackets)\n       - Subject: Email subject line (from the thread)\n       - Time: Timestamp of the most recent message (usually top right)\n       - Text: Main email body content of the LATEST message only (not the entire thread history)\n    \n    5. IMPORTANT: \n       - For threads, only extract the newest unread message, not old messages\n       - Look for the message that is currently unread/bold\n       - Ignore quoted text or previous messages in the thread\n    \n    6. Access specific UI elements by ID or text content.\n    7. Tap 'Back' to return to email list.\n    8. Return extracted data.\n    \n    NOTE: The email is now marked as read automatically, so the next \"is:unread\" search will show different emails.\n    ",
