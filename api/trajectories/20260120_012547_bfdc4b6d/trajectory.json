The current phone state shows that the Gmail app is open, and a search for \"is:unread\" has already been performed. The UI clearly indicates \"No matches for \u2018is:unread\u2019\" (index 14). This means there are no unread emails to process. According to the task instructions, if the list of search results is empty, I should return an empty 'EmailList' and stop.\n\n**Agent Action:**",
